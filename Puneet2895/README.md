Redpitaya
=========================================================================================================================
Red Pitaya is a single-board, open instrumentation and control platform which replaces many expensive laboratory and field instruments at a surprising price tag. It is based on the Xilinx Zynq All Programmable SoC, which combines a dual-core ARM Cortex-A9 with a heavy-duty set of peripherals and a chunk of Xilinx 7 series programmable logic.

We @Energy Lab IIITD are planning to use this for HF sensing of both EMI and Harmonics present in electrical power lines.

Stay Tuned :)
